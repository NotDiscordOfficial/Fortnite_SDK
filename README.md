# Fortnite Dumped SDK
An SDK (Software Development Kit) is a set of tools that provides a developer with the ability to call functions.
This SDK (consisting of header files) can be used in your Fortnite tools to help you use Fortnite (Unreal Engine 4) engine functions.
For the skids/pasters here, you will be able to find the offsets you need in **FortniteGame_classes.h**.

# How often is this updated?
Usually when I get a chance or can be bothered to.

# Credits
I would like to thank these people for making it possible for me to dump Fortnite's SDK.
